# Jase bank app

<p>This is a bank app inpsired by the Chase bank app (I just added a j to it because my name is Jacob). You have the ability to create a user and bank accounts with that user.
The funds in the bank accounts are able to be transferred between themselves and the bank accounts are able to be closed.
